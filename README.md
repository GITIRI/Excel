# CREATING INTERACTIVE DASHBOARDS USING EXCEL
In this project, I created an interactive dashboard using excel. The dashboard helps us to derive insights on bike sales at a glance and can be manipulated with a few clicks.

The process involved:

    1. Understanding and cleaning the data 
    
    2. Creating pivot tables and charts based on different metrics
    
    3. Creating a beautiful dashboard that can be manipulated to show different statistics based on the assigned slicers
